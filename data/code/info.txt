    1. You can assign yourself a game role in *#self-assign-roles*. When you want to setup a lobby type m!lobby into the game's channel.
        1a. Do not ping a role excessively in a short time. The command's cooldown is 20 minutes.
        1b. Only use the ping to set up lobbies. Not for advertising, pointless announcements, etc.
        1c. Only give yourself a role if you don't mind Discord pings.
        1d. Do not complain about the pings if they're being used correctly. Remove the role, or you will be punished by moderators.

    2. Only server staff can use @ everyone & @ here.
    3. If you are a Youtube Sponsor or Twitch Subscriber, you can get the role if you sync your Twitch/Youtube account with your Discord account
        by going into User Settings > Connections > Twitch/Youtube.
        3a. This might not work on mobile.
        3b. We cannot assign SponSub roles manually.

4. Mankalor will ping @ notificationsquad for new videos and streams in #new-videos-streams. If you want these pings, type `m!role Notification Squad` in #self-assign-roles
        
5. Server link in case you want to invite someone. This link is in the description of my videos, too: https://discord.gg/DQkWVbz

Not following these rules will result in a warning, mute, or ban, depending on the severity and number of offenses.

If you notice anything wrong, notify the *Server Staff*!

Once you've sent the code, go say hi in *#general-off-topic*!
